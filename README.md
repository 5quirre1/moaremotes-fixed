Emoji archive userscript for pikidiary.lol
# How bro?
[Wayback Machine CDX API](https://archive.org/developers/wayback-cdx-server.html). 
* Here's the [exact query](https://web.archive.org/cdx/search/cdx?url=pikidiary.lol/uploads/emotes/*&from=2025&filter=mimetype:image/gif&fl=original&output=json) if you're interested.
* Uploaded to a [Github Gist](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/ozgq/82444ab3580961b1814c3239ecc78dd5/raw/818d6ad062571e7c23d9f6e443bd2ef02512a560/emotes.json) because Wayback Machine loadtimes are still abysmal.
* If some emotes are broken or redundant, [let me know](https://github.com/ozgq/moaremotes/issues).
* Oh yeah also regex. Was not made by me. Because I didn't want to make it.
